Description: A wrapper around several more specialized packages: `bnpsd` for admixture, `simfam` for family structure, and `simtrait` for complex traits.  This package assumes reasonable defaults and generally saves on typing for some recurrent cases.  Key non-trivial functionality is drawing genotypes for admixed families whose loci are all polymorphic.
